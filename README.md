## DISCLAIMER:
- Code below is my attempt to recreate the game '2048'.
- Code below is not understandable and clean at all, someday, i hope, it will be :)
- It is not the correct way how to do it!

**If you want to try this yourself, be aware that:**
- If you are using macOS or linux: change *os.system('cls')* to *os.system('clear')*.
- Input is case sensitive!
- Many 'features' are not implemented yet.
- Gameplay is not 100% identical... yet.
